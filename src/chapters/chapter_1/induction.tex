\subsection{Prove that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = n(n+1)/2$ for $n \geq 0$, by induction}
  \textbf{Question number:} 1-10.

  \begin{proof}[Proof by induction]

    For any integer value $n > 0$, let $P(n)$ denote the statement $P(n) = (\sum_{i=1}^n i \doteq n(n+1)/2)$.

    \textbf{Base step $(n=1)$}

    \begin{align}
      P(1) &= 1(1+1)/2\\
           &= 1(2)/2\\
           &= 2/2\\
           &= 1
    \end{align}

    Thus, the base step is true.

    \textbf{Inductive step}
    Assume all of $P(1), ..., P(n)$ are true. Then we show that $P(n+1)$ is true as well:

    ...

    Thus it proves that the equation $n(n+1)/2$ to find the sum of all the
    integers from $1$ to $n$ is true.
    \qedhere
